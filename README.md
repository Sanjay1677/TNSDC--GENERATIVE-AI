# TNSDC--GENERATIVE-AI

Lion Image Generation using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

Overview:

This project aims to generate realistic and diverse images of lions using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model learns to create lifelike representations of lions by training on a curated dataset of lion images. The generated images hold potential applications in wildlife conservation, education, digital media, and art.

Key Features:

Utilizes GAN architecture for image generation.
Incorporates deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
Implements feature matching to enhance image quality.
Augments and curates dataset for diversity and representativeness.
Fine-tunes hyperparameters for optimized training.
Defines evaluation metrics for objective assessment.
Explores transfer learning for improved generalization.
Considers ethical implications throughout the modeling process.
